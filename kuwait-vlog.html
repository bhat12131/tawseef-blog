  <h1>My Life in Kuwait – A Day in My Shoes</h1>
  <p>Assalamualaikum and welcome to my first vlog-style blog post.</p>

  <p>My name is Tawseef, and I’m originally from Kashmir. Right now, I live in Kuwait, working in a restaurant as a cashier and front-of-house staff. It’s been quite a journey so far, full of learning, growth, and challenges.</p>

  <h2>My Daily Routine</h2>
  <p>I usually wake up around 5:30 AM. After getting ready and offering my Fajr prayer, I prepare myself for a 12-hour shift from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM. It's not always easy, but I believe every struggle has a purpose.</p>

  <p>During work, I meet people from different backgrounds — Arabs, South Asians, and tourists. I’ve learned how to communicate better, manage time, and stay focused even during busy hours.</p>

  <h2>Life Outside Work</h2>
  <p>When I get back home (usually around 8 PM), I try to stay connected with my family and my goals. I’ve started building this blog to share my journey and to hopefully build something bigger in the future — maybe earn from it, maybe inspire someone, maybe both.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>This is just the beginning. I believe in doing things quietly, with sincerity, and letting the results speak. I hope this blog becomes a small window into my world — and maybe, yours too.</p>

  <p>Thank you for reading. More to come, In shaa Allah.</p>
